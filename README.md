AMICore is a mod for Minecraft 1.16.5 used as a basis for custom items in the AMI modpack. On It's own, this mod only adds 9 creative tabs (forcing them forward), and 17 malum spirits. 

As of version 1.4 it also adds Crafttweaker functionality to the Malum spirit altar, as well as fixes bugs related to it.
